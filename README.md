## üöÄ Getting Started

1. (Optional, for faster query results) Start indexing your workspace from Neovim:

   ```vim
   :ContextPilotStartIndexing
   ```
2. (Optional, for faster query results) OR Index some selected repositories:

  ```lua
  :ContextPilotIndexSubDirectory
  ```

  Choose the subdirectories you want to index (hitting `Tab`) and let the indexing finish.

2. Use any of the following commands to retrieve relevant files:

  - `:ContextPilotRelevantCommitsRange` - Fetch relevant commits for **selected range** of lines.
   - `:ContextPilotRelevantFilesWholeFile` ‚Äî Fetch contextually relevant files for the **current file**.
   - `:ContextPilotRelevantFilesRange` ‚Äî Fetch relevant files for a **selected range** of lines.
